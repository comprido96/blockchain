# ERC20 token

  
1. Write and unit test your own ERC20 token with mint/burn features for contract creator. Do **not** use any libraries for token logic (you can use AccessControl or Ownable for mint/burn functions protection). The contract should conform to the [ERC-20 standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20), which means it should include all the functions and events described in the standard, keeping their names.  
2. Write tests.  
3. Write deploy script.  
4. Deploy on Sepolia testnet.  
5. Write tasks for mint, transfer, transferFrom, approve.  
6. Verify the contract.
